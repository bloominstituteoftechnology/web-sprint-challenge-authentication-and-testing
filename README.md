# Authentication and Testing Sprint Challenge

## Tools

- Node >= 16.x
- NPM >= 8.x (update NPM executing `npm i -g npm`)
- Unix-like shell (Gitbash/bash/zsh)

## Project Setup

- Fork, clone, and `npm install`.
- Build your database executing `npm run migrate`.
- Run tests locally executing `npm test`.

## Project Instructions

Dad jokes are all the rage these days! In this challenge, you will build a real wise-guy application.

Users must be able to call the `[POST] /api/auth/register` endpoint to create a new account, and the `[POST] /api/auth/login` endpoint to get a token.

We also need to make sure nobody without the token can call `[GET] /api/jokes` and gain access to our dad jokes.

We will hash the user's password using `bcryptjs`, and use JSON Web Tokens and the `jsonwebtoken` library.

### MVP

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements (further instructions are found inside each file):

- [ ] An authentication workflow with functionality for account creation and login, implemented inside `api/auth/auth-router.js`.
- [ ] Middleware used to restrict access to resources from non-authenticated requests, implemented inside `api/middleware/restricted.js`.
- [ ] A minimum of 2 tests per API endpoint, written inside `api/server.test.js`.

**IMPORTANT Notes:**

- Do not exceed 2^8 rounds of hashing with `bcryptjs`.
- If you use environment variables make sure to provide fallbacks in the code (e.g. `process.env.SECRET || "shh"`).
- You are welcome to create additional files but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install extra libraries. Do not update existing packages.
- The database already has the `users` table, but if you run into issues, the migration is available.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing.
