  DO NOT EXCEED 2^8 ROUNDS OF HASHING!

  1- In order to register a new account the client must provide `username` and `password`:
    {
      "username": "Captain Marvel", // must not exist already in the `users` table
      "password": "foobar"          // needs to be hashed before it's saved
    }

  2- On SUCCESSFUL registration,
    the response body should have `id`, `username` and `password`:
    {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "Captain Marvel",
      "password": "2a$08$jG.wIGR2S4hxuyWNcBf9MuoC4y0dNy7qC/LbmtuFBSdIhWks2LhpG"
    }

  3- On FAILED registration due to `username` or `password` missing from the request body,
    the response body should include a string exactly as follows: "username and password required".

  4- On FAILED registration due to the `username` being taken,
    the response body should include a string exactly as follows: "username taken".
